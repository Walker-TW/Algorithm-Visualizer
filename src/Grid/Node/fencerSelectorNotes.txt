Need to do two things
- Create button that will switch the mouse clicks to walls 

- OR make it so that mouseenter etc events set start and finish nodes
- - And the double click on a node will change it to a start/finish node
- - Thing to make sure of here is that the wall selector is 
automatically set to false when this happens

- - MouseEnter would set a boolean that the mouse is clicked 
so we can use mouseenter to get inside and
toggle it 
- - that way when you lift up on the click it mouseisclicked will 
default to true and not be able to
make walls anymore (allowing you to switch between them both easily)


Pseudo

- Button Toggle
- - fenceToggle DEFAULT false X
- - onClick == function (which turns this true in the grid state) X

- On mousedown X
- - set fenceSelector = true
- - WHEN fenceSelector.true & button toggle has happened
- - THEN set fence = true

- On mouseenter X
- - if fenceSelector = true & button toggle 
- - set fence = true

- On mouseup X
- - set fenceSelector = false
