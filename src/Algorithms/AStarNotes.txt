- First thing to do is decide on a heuristic
 - manhatten seems the best as we cannot move in diagonals
 - therefore need to create a function which creates this distance 
 for every node in the grid

- Then test this to be sure it is giving the correct result on every
node (TDD)

- When the funtion is fully tested on implementation of A* set this distance
to every node and store in the object

- Sort the nodes based off (heuristic + the weight at that moment) 
return them in a sorted list
(have a look at what to do if the distance changes i.e. fences)

- iterate through this queue sorting the nodes again as the weights 
change (luckily the heuristic base value will stay the same)

-return a completed reversed list (like dijkstra) when you reach the end

- Track back and animate in the same way as well
