Give all nodes an infinity property

Create an array to hold all visted nodes (in order)

Create a method/array with all unvisted nodes

Set the start node distance to 0 (lets rename it)

Have a method that finds the neightbours of our visted nodes
and then updates their distances

Get a method that gets all nodes

Make a method that finds all nodes in the shortest path
- this can be done by going backwards from our sorted node path
